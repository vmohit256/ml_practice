C. and P. K. Trivedi (2005): Microeconometrics: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press, New York.</ref>  When dealing with duration data (such as employment spells or [[Mortality rate|mortality]] outcomes), the data [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] method has a direct impact on subsequent analyses and [[Statistical inference|inference]]. An example in demography would be sampling the number of people who die within a given time frame (e.g. a specific calendar year); a popular example in economics would be the number of people leaving unemployment within a given time frame (e.g. a specific quarter).<ref name=\"auto1\">Salant, S. (1977): Search Theory and Duration Data: A Theory of Sorts. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 91(1), pp. 39–57.</ref> Researchers imposing similar assumptions but using different sampling methods, can reach fundamentally different conclusions if the [[joint distribution]] across the flow and stock samples differ.<ref>Chesher, A. and T. Lancaster (1981): Stock and Flow Sampling. Economics Letters 8(1), pp. 63–65.</ref>\\n\\nTypically, flow samples suffer from right [[Censoring (statistics)|censoring]]. After a certain amount of time, as the sampling interval ends, the individuals in the sample are not followed any longer, outcomes are recorded and the data is analyzed. In the unemployment example outlined above, we observe the exact duration for individuals leaving unemployment within the time frame. For people that haven\\'t left unemployment yet, we only observe the lower bound of the unemployment spell.<ref>Wooldridge, J. (2002): Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass.</ref>  The difference between stock and flow sampling can also help explain why certain statistics that measure similar duration measures can differ in important ways. Consider, for instance, the Average Interrupted Duration (AID), the average period for which people that are currently unemployed have been unemployed, and ACD, the average duration of the complete unemployment spell for employed people. Salant shows that heterogeneity in hazard rates between the stock and the flow distribution provides a key to understanding why these two statistics differ. For instance, if the probability of getting a job offer goes down with time unemployed, E[\\'\\'T\\'\\']&nbsp;<&nbsp;E[\\'\\'S\\'\\'], where \\'\\'S\\'\\' and \\'\\'T\\'\\' stand for observed and actual duration respectively.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\\n\\n[[Renewal theory]] is the appropriate tool for handling these issues,<ref name=\"auto\"/>  and a wide range of estimators have been proposed. These estimators range from fully parametric models such as the Mixed Proportional Hazard model,<ref>Lancaster, T. (1979): Econometric Methods for the Duration of Unemployment. Econometrica 47(4), pp. 939–956.</ref> to [[nonparametric]] and semiparametric methods.<ref>Hausman, J. A. and T.
