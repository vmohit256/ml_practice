A joystick, also known as the \\'\\'\\'control column\\'\\'\\', is the principal control device in the [[cockpit]] of many civilian and military aircraft, either as a [[centre stick]] or [[side-stick]]. It has various switches to control functions of the aircraft controlled by the Pilot and First Officer of the flight.\\n\\nJoysticks are often used to control video games, and usually have one or more than one push-buttons whose state can also be read by the computer.  A popular variation of the joystick used on modern [[video game console]]s is the [[analog stick]]. Joysticks are also used for controlling machines such as cranes, trucks, underwater unmanned vehicles, wheelchairs, surveillance cameras, and [[Zero-turn mower|zero turning radius lawn mowers]]. Miniature finger-operated joysticks have been adopted as input devices for smaller electronic equipment such as [[mobile phone]]s.\\n\\n== Aviation ==\\n[[Image:Glidercockpit.JPG|right|thumb|Cockpit of a glider with its joystick visible]]\\n\\nJoysticks originated as controls for aircraft [[aileron]]s and [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]]s, and are first known to have been used as such on [[Louis Bleriot]]\\'s [[Bleriot VIII]] aircraft of 1908, in combination with a foot-operated rudder bar for the yaw control surface on the tail.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20090725/world/english-channel-armada-to-mark-centenary-of-louis-bleriot-flight.266688|title=English Channel Armada to Mark Centenary of Louis Blériot Flight|author=AFP|newspaper=[[Times of Malta]]|date=25 July 2009|access-date=14 September 2015}}</ref>\\n\\n== Origins ==\\nThe name \\'\\'joystick\\'\\' is thought to originate with early 20th century French pilot [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Zeller | first = Tom Jr. | title = A Great Idea That\\'s All in the Wrist | newspaper = New York Times | date = 2005-06-05 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/weekinreview/05zeller.html?ex=1275624000&en=127d9054b0921b1d | access-date = 2006-09-07 }}</ref> There are also competing claims on behalf of fellow pilots [[Robert Loraine]], [[James Henry Joyce]], and [[Arthur Edward George|A.

Loraine is cited by the \\'\\'Oxford English Dictionary\\'\\' for using the term \"joystick\" in his diary in 1909 when he went to [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] to learn to fly at [[Louis Blériot|Blériot\\'s]] school. George was a pioneer aviator who with his colleague Jobling built and flew a biplane at Newcastle in England in 1910. The George and Jobling aircraft control column is in the collection of the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne, England.\\nJoysticks were present in early planes, though their mechanical origins are uncertain.<ref>{{cite web | last = Quinion | first = Michael | title = Questions & Answers: Joystick | publisher = [[World Wide Words]] | date = 2004-07-17 | url = http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-joy1.htm | access-date = 2006-09-07 }}</ref> The coining of the term \"joystick\" may actually be credited to Loraine, as his is the earliest known usage of the term, although he most certainly did not invent the device.\\n\\n==Electronic joysticks==\\n===History===\\nThe electrical two-axis joystick was invented by C.

Here, the joystick of the \\'\\'Kehl\\'\\' transmitter was used by an operator to steer the missile towards its target. This joystick had on-off switches rather than analogue sensors. Both the Hs 293 and Fritz-X used FuG 230 \\'\\'Straßburg\\'\\' radio receivers in them to send the \\'\\'Kehl\\'s\\'\\' control signals to the ordnance\\'s control surfaces.  A comparable  joystick unit was used for the contemporary American [[Azon]] steerable munition, strictly to laterally steer the munition in the yaw axis only.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=United States Office of Strategic Services |year=1943 |title=WW2: Azon (1943) Radio-Controlled Dive Bomb |medium=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qTTgn-PFuM | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205220405/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qTTgn-PFuM| archive-date=2013-12-05 | url-status=dead|access-date=July 21, 2013 |publisher=The Digital Implosion}}</ref>\\n\\nThis German invention was picked up by someone in the team of scientists assembled at the \\'\\'Heeresversuchsanstalt\\'\\' in [[Peenemuende|Peenemünde]]. Here a part of the team on the German [[rocket]] program was developing the [[Wasserfall missile]], a variant of the [[V-2 rocket]], the first ground-to-air [[missile]]. The Wasserfall steering equipment converted the electrical signal to radio signals and transmitted these to the missile.\\n\\n[[File:Prototype Gemini Hand Controller.jpg|thumb|upright|A prototype [[Project Gemini]] joystick-type hand controller, 1962]]\\nIn the 1960s the use of joysticks became widespread in radio-controlled model aircraft systems such as the Kwik Fly produced by Phill Kraft (1964). The now-defunct [[Kraft Systems]] firm eventually became an important OEM supplier of joysticks to the computer industry and other users. The first use of joysticks outside the radio-controlled aircraft industry may have been in the control of powered wheelchairs, such as the [[Permobil]] (1963). During this time period NASA used joysticks as control devices as part of the Apollo missions. For example, the lunar lander test models were controlled with a joystick.\\n\\nIn many modern [[airliner]]s, for example all Airbus aircraft developed from the 1980s, the joystick has received a new lease on life for flight control in the form of the \"[[side-stick]],\" a controller similar to a gaming joystick but which is used to control flight, replacing the traditional [[Yoke (aircraft)|yoke]]. The sidestick saves weight, improves movement and visibility in the cockpit, and may be safer in an accident than the yoke.\\n\\n===Electronic games===\\n[[File:Ch products mach 2 joystick.jpg|thumb|CH Products Mach II analog joystick for Apple II computers.

In fact, the use of such joysticks is in such high demand, that it has virtually replaced the traditional mechanical control lever in nearly all modern hydraulic control systems.  Additionally, most [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs) and [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|submersible remotely operated vehicle]]s (ROVs) require at least one joystick to control either the vehicle, the on-board cameras, sensors and/or manipulators.\\n\\nDue to the highly hands-on, rough nature of such applications, the industrial joystick tends to be more robust than the typical video-game controller, and able to function over a high cycle life. This led to the development and employment of [[Hall effect]] sensing to such applications in the 1980s as a means of contactless sensing. Several companies produce joysticks for industrial applications using Hall effect technology.  Another technology used in joystick design is the use of strain gauges to build force transducers from which the output is proportional to the force applied rather than physical deflection.  Miniature force transducers are used as additional controls on joysticks for menu selection functions.\\n\\nSome larger manufacturers of joysticks are able to customize joystick handles and grips specific to the OEM needs while small regional manufacturers often concentrate on selling standard products at higher prices to smaller OEMs.\\n\\n== Assistive technology ==\\nSpecialist joysticks, classed as an [[assistive technology]] [[pointing device]], are used to replace the [[computer mouse]] for people with fairly severe physical disabilities. Rather than controlling games, these joysticks control the [[pointer (user interface)|pointer]]. They are often useful to people with [[Athetosis|athetoid]] conditions, such as [[cerebral palsy]], who find them easier to grasp than a standard mouse.<ref>{{cite news|author=Darleen Hartley|date=22 May 2009|title=Robotics Improves Movement in Kids with Cerebral Palsy|publisher=[[geek.com]]|url=http://www.geek.com/gadgets/robotics-improves-movement-in-kids-with-cerebral-palsy-781412/|url-status=dead|access-date=16 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820115501/http://www.geek.com/gadgets/robotics-improves-movement-in-kids-with-cerebral-palsy-781412/|archive-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref> Miniature joysticks are available for people with conditions involving muscular weakness such as [[muscular dystrophy]] or [[motor neurone disease]] as well.
